### Byte Pair Encoding Tokenizer
A simple and minimal implementation of a byte pair encoding text tokenizer written in python.

### Quick start
Just
```bash
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukasnxyz/txttokens/main/tokens.py"
```
into the repo you're working in, it's much easier.

See `example_tokenize.py` for an example on how to setup and tokenize a data set.
